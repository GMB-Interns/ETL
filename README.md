# ETL
Simple Extract-Transform and Load application for backing up data, cleaning, scrubbing and restoring

# Product Vision Statement

## Vision

Our project's vision is to develop an open-source ETL system based on FastAPI that empowers users to seamlessly integrate, transform, and load data between various sources. With a focus on scalability, security, and flexibility, we aim to provide a comprehensive solution that ensures data privacy, enables anonymization options, supports the creation of test/QA data sources, and facilitates reliable monitoring and error handling. Our goal is to foster collaboration and innovation within the data community by creating a powerful ETL tool that is accessible, extensible, and adaptable.

## Goals

1. Build a robust and extensible ETL system that is open-source and free for the community to use and contribute to.
2. Provide seamless integration capabilities with a wide range of data sources, including databases, APIs, and file formats.
3. Develop efficient data transformation mechanisms to handle diverse data mappings, conversions, and aggregations.
4. Incorporate anonymization options to allow users to protect sensitive data during the extraction and export process.
5. Enable the creation of test/QA data sources that facilitate data testing, validation, and simulation of real-world scenarios.
6. Establish comprehensive monitoring and error handling mechanisms to ensure the reliability and stability of the ETL system.
7. Foster an active community around the project by encouraging collaboration, contributions, and knowledge sharing.
