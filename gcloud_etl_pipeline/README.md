# ETL
Simple Extract-Transform and Load application for backing up data, cleaning, scrubbing and restoring

Ourvision is to deliver a robust and efficient ETL system based on FastAPI that seamlessly integrates with various data sources, provides flexible data transformation capabilities, enables anonymization options, facilitates the creation of test/QA data sources, and ensures reliable monitoring and error handling. Our goal is to empower users to easily extract, transform, and load data between sources, while maintaining data privacy and quality assurance.

# Goals:

- Build a scalable and secure ETL system that supports seamless integration with multiple data sources.
- Develop data transformation capabilities to handle diverse data formats and mappings.
- Implement anonymization options to enable users to protect sensitive data during the export process.
- Create a test/QA data source functionality that facilitates efficient testing and validation.
- Ensure reliable monitoring and error handling mechanisms to proactively detect and resolve issues.
