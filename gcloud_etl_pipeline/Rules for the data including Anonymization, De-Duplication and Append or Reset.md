# Data Management Rules

## Anonymization (Yes/No):
- Yes: Anonymize sensitive data whenever possible to protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations.
- No: Do not anonymize data only if there are strong business justifications for retaining personally identifiable information (PII).

## Append or Reset:
- Append: Add new data to existing records when relevant, ensuring that historical data remains intact.
- Reset: Start with a clean slate when necessary, particularly if older data becomes obsolete or if the system requires periodic resets for performance or security reasons.
- Clearly define criteria for deciding when to append and when to reset data.
