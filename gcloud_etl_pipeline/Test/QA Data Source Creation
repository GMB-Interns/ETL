# Defining Structure and Requirements for Test/QA Data Source

## 1. Purpose and Scope

- Purpose: The test/QA data source is intended to support quality assurance and testing efforts for our e-commerce platform.
- Scope: It will include data related to customer profiles, product listings, orders, and transaction history.

## 2. Data Types

- 1. Activity Data:**
   - Tables related to various activities and templates, such as `activity_category`, `activity_activitytemplate`, `activity_note`, `activity_habit`, and more.
   - These tables likely store information about user activities, habits, notes, and templates for activities.
- 2. Avatar Data:**
   - Tables related to avatars, including `avatar_avatareyes`, `avatar_avatarhair`, `avatar_avatarmouth`, and `avatar_avatarbody`.
   - These tables might store data about avatar customization options.
- 3. Billing Data:**
   - Tables related to billing and subscriptions, such as `billing_subscriptionplan`, `billing_paymentsubscription`, and more.
   - These tables likely contain information about subscription plans, payment details, and billing history.
- 4. Challenge Data:**
   - Tables related to challenges, invitations, and chat messages, including `challenge_challenge`, `challenge_challengeinvite`, and `challenge_challengechatmessage`.
   - This data type appears to be related to challenges and interactions among users participating in challenges.
- 5. Member Data:**
   - Tables related to user accounts and member information, such as `member_user`, `member_loginhistory`, `member_notification`, and more.
   - These tables likely store user profiles, login history, notifications, and related data.
- 6. Scoring Data:**
   - Tables related to scoring and rewards, including `scoring_grouplevel`, `scoring_difficulty`, `scoring_rewardexperience`, and more.
   - This data type may involve tracking user scores, difficulty levels, and rewards or experiences earned.

## 3. Data Format and Structure

- Relational Database: We will use a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store the data.
- Database Schema: The schema will consist of tables for customers, users, billings, activity, and so. Relationships will be defined using foreign keys.

## 4. Data Volume

- A total of 100 data tables suggest that the database contains data related to user profiles, authentication, social interactions, challenges, memberships, communication preferences, and more.
- Tables like silk_request, silk_response, silk_profile, and others related to profiling and requests might contain detailed historical data, which could potentially result in a significant data volume.

## 5. Data Generation Requirements

- Realistic Test Data: Generate data that closely resembles production data, including customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
- Anonymization: Anonymize sensitive customer information like email addresses and phone numbers for privacy compliance.
- Data Variance: Include variations in product availability and customer behavior to simulate real-world scenarios

## 6. Data Updates and Maintenance

- Frequency: Refresh the data source quarterly to reflect changes in the production environment.
- Automation: Implement an automated data refresh process to keep the test/QA data current.

## 7. Access and Permissions

- Access Control: Define user roles (e.g., QA testers, developers) and permissions to ensure controlled access.
- Read-Only Access: Most users will have read-only access to the data source.

## 8. Compliance and Security

- Security Measures: Implement robust security measures, including encryption of sensitive data and access controls.
- Compliance: Ensure that the test/QA data source complies with data privacy regulations.

## 9. Integration Requirements

- Integration with Testing Tools: The data source should integrate seamlessly with testing tools and environments, such as test automation frameworks.

## 10. Documentation

- Data Dictionary: Maintain a data dictionary detailing table structures, column definitions, and data constraints.
- Schema Diagram: Create a visual representation of the database schema for reference.
