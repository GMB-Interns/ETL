# Rules for the data （including Anonymization,Append or Reset）

## Anonymization (Yes/No):
- Yes: Anonymize sensitive data whenever possible to protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations. Ensure that personally identifiable information (PII) is stripped or encrypted, and sensitive information is replaced with non-identifiable values.
- No: Do not anonymize data only if there are strong business justifications for retaining personally identifiable information (PII). Clearly document and justify the reasons for not anonymizing, ensuring that they align with legal and business requirements.

## Append or Reset:
- Append: Add new data to existing records when relevant, ensuring that historical data remains intact.
- Reset: Start with a clean slate when necessary, particularly if older data becomes obsolete or if the system requires periodic resets for performance or security reasons.
- Clearly define criteria for deciding when to append and when to reset data.
